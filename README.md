![](https://github.com/jesusmartinoza/Concurrent-libgdx/blob/master/readme/demo.gif)

 - Consider an organization with three smokers and an agent.
 - Each smoker continuously rolls a cigarette and then smokes it.
 - To roll and smoke a cigarette, the smoker needs 3 ingredients: tobacco, paper and matches.
 - One of the smokers has paper, another tobacco and the last one has matches.
 - The agent has an infinite supply of all three materials.
 - The agent places two of the three ingredients on the table randomly.
 - The smoker who has the remaining ingredient then makes a cigarette and smokes it at random time.
 - The agent puts two more of the three ingredients, and the cycle repeats itself infinitely.
